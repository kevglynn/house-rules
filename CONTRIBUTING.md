# Contributing

This kit is a shared asset. Contributions — new rules, new skills, rule improvements, script enhancements, documentation — are welcome from anyone using it. For skill contributions specifically, see the format and checklist in [skills/README.md](skills/README.md).

## Before you start

1. Read the [Core Concepts](docs/concepts.md) to understand the four components
2. Skim the rule you want to change (or the closest existing rule to what you want to add)
3. Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes — your idea may already be in progress

## How to propose a change

**Small fixes** (typos, broken links, clarifications): Edit directly and open a PR.

**Rule changes** (new behavior, modified guidance): Open an issue first describing:
- What agent behavior you want to change
- Why the current rules produce the wrong behavior
- What the new behavior should look like
- How you'd measure whether it worked (see [Rule Effectiveness Scorecard](docs/rule-effectiveness-scorecard.md))

**New rules**: Start with the issue process above. New rules should have a clear domain that doesn't overlap with existing rules. The operating model rule is the router — it references all other rules but shouldn't absorb their content.

## Rule change intake — field lessons

Real incidents — bugs shipped, beads closed on IOUs, tests that missed the callsite — are the highest-signal input to rule changes. Lessons come from any repo the operator works in. The playbook consumes them on these terms:

1. **Universal form only.** The proposed rule edit must be project-agnostic. Strip language, framework, library, and project names from the rule text. If the rule only makes sense with that context, it is not rule-worthy — it belongs as a project memory (`bd remember`), not a playbook rule.
2. **Project-specific patterns stay in the originating repo's `bd memories`.** The playbook rule captures the universal policy; the originating project's memory captures the specific pattern to grep for, the library quirk, the stack trace. The two complement each other and should not be merged.
3. **Proposal-first, apply-second.** The requesting party (operator, subagent, or colleague) drafts the diff as a proposal — no edits to `.mdc` files until the playbook operator approves. This protects the rule surface from hasty or inconsistent changes.
4. **CHANGELOG attribution is technical, not nominal.** Describe the shape of the incident — what class of failure, what the rule prevents — without naming specific projects unless the project is part of this repo's ecosystem. Colleagues reading the CHANGELOG should learn what the rule does, not need context about unrelated repos.
5. **Tooling enforcement is a separate concern.** If the lesson suggests that a tool (e.g., `bd`, lint-style checks) should enforce the policy at runtime, that is a feature request against the tool's repo, not a playbook rule change. The playbook says *what* should be true; tools can enforce *at the boundary*. Keep the two tracks separate and file them independently.

### When intake is rule-worthy vs memory-worthy

Ask: "Would the next session of any agent, in any repo, benefit from knowing this — or is it specific to this codebase's libraries, frameworks, or history?" Universal → rule. Specific → memory.

Examples:

| Incident | Rule-worthy universal lesson | Memory-worthy specific pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Agent closed a bug bead with "will be re-verified in PR manual-check" and the bug reached production | "Close reasons cannot defer AC verification" (→ `bead-completion.mdc`) | N/A — the lesson is universal |
| Swift String closed-range crash where `replaceSubrange(a...b, ...)` with `b == endIndex` panics | "After a helper fix, grep for the bug pattern class across the codebase" (→ `pragmatic-tdd.mdc`) | "Swift closed-range on String where `upperBound == endIndex` crashes — prefer half-open ranges" (→ that project's `bd remember`) |
| A race condition pattern unique to one app's event bus | N/A — too specific | "Event bus `publish()` is async but `subscribe()` is sync — ordering is not guaranteed" (→ that project's `bd remember`) |

When in doubt, propose both: a rule edit (universal) and a memory (specific). They strengthen each other and are cheap to maintain together.

## The edit/sync/test cycle

### 1. Edit the canonical source

Rules live in `cursor/rules/*.mdc`. These are the single source of truth. Never edit `claude/rules/*.md` directly — those are generated.

```bash
# Edit the rule
vim cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
```

### 2. Regenerate Claude rules

```bash
./scripts/sync-rules.sh --format claude --local
```

### 3. Test before pushing

```bash
# Preview what would be synced (no writes)
./scripts/sync-rules.sh --dry-run

# Check if any targets are out of date
./scripts/sync-rules.sh --check
./scripts/sync-rules.sh --format claude --check

# Validate your own setup
bash scripts/playbook-doctor.sh
```

### 4. Update the CHANGELOG

Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under today's date. Group by category (Rules, Scripts, Docs). Describe *what changed*, not *what you did*.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### Rules
- **my-rule.mdc**: Added X to handle Y situation. Agents now do Z instead of W.
```

### 5. Open a PR

Include:
- The CHANGELOG entry
- Which rules/scripts changed and why
- If it's a rule change: how to verify the new behavior (e.g., "start a session and say 'Planner mode' — agent should now do X")

## Rule conventions

### File structure (`.mdc`)

```
---
description: One-line description of what this rule does
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---

# Rule Title

## Section
Content...
```

- `alwaysApply: true` for rules agents should always follow
- Use `globs` for rules that activate only on specific file patterns
- Keep rules under 250 lines — agents tend to skim long rules

### Writing style

- **Imperative voice**: "Run `bd ready`" not "The agent should run `bd ready`"
- **Tool-neutral**: Say "project scratchpad" not "`.cursor/scratchpad.md`"
- **Concrete examples**: Show the exact command, not just describe it
- **No Cursor/Claude-specific references** in rule body text — keep those in dispatch sections (like multi-agent-review's "How to launch review passes")

### Line budget

`operating-model.mdc` is the largest rule at ~200 lines. If your change pushes any rule over 250 lines, consider extracting a section into a new standalone rule.

## Script conventions

- All scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -uo pipefail`
- Support `--help` with usage examples
- Use the skip-if-exists pattern: check before acting, print `[skip]` when nothing to do
- Print clear success/failure indicators (checkmarks, X marks)
- Exit 0 on success, 1 on failure — scripts should be CI-friendly

## Versioning

The playbook uses semantic versioning via `VERSION` file and git tags.

- **Patch** (1.0.x): Typo fixes, clarifications, documentation updates
- **Minor** (1.x.0): New rules, new script features, behavior changes
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to rule structure or script interfaces

To create a release:

```bash
# Update VERSION file
echo "1.1.0" > VERSION

# Ensure CHANGELOG has entries for this version
# Commit, tag, push
git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Release v1.1.0"
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

Teams pin to versions via `sync-rules.sh --version v1.0.0`. Breaking changes should be communicated before tagging.

## Subagents

The `.cursor/agents/` directory contains specialized analysis agents for maintaining the kit itself:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `rules-auditor` | Audits rule quality, consistency, coverage gaps |
| `beads-strategist` | Analyzes beads usage maturity, proposes advanced patterns |
| `docs-automation-architect` | Audits docs and automation for quality and friction |
| `x-factor-innovator` | Generates novel ideas for extending kit value |
| `rule-efficacy-analyst` | Measures whether rule changes improve agent behavior |

To run an analysis, use Cursor's subagent feature or Claude Code's Task tool with the agent definition as the prompt/context. Results should inform changes, not be committed directly.

## Measuring impact

Before and after rule changes, use the [Rule Effectiveness Scorecard](docs/rule-effectiveness-scorecard.md) to measure whether the change actually improved agent behavior. The scorecard has:

- A 20-item session checklist
- Baseline establishment protocol
- Experiment template for rigorous evaluation

Rule changes without measurement evidence are still welcome — but if you can show before/after data, the change is much more convincing.

## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by [The Agentic Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — the first Code of Conduct designed for communities where humans and AI agents collaborate. All contributors, whether working directly or through AI agents, are expected to uphold these standards.

Key points for contributors:
- AI-assisted contributions are explicitly welcome
- Disclose substantial AI assistance using the `Assisted-by` convention
- You are accountable for everything submitted under your account, including agent-generated content
- See [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md) for how governance fits into the playbook
