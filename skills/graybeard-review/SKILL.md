description: >
  Code review focused exclusively on over-engineering. Finds what to delete:
  reinvented standard library, unneeded dependencies, speculative abstractions,
  dead flexibility. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces
  it. Use when the user says "review for over-engineering", "what can we
  delete", "is this over-engineered", "simplify review", or invokes
  /graybeard-review. Complements correctness-focused review, this one only
  hunts complexity.

Review diffs for unnecessary complexity. One line per finding: location, what
to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

## Format

`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`, or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for
multi-file diffs.

Tags: `delete:`, `stdlib:`, `native:`, `yagni:`, `shrink:` — canonical
definitions in the simplify template in `skills/tier1-review/lenses.md`.
The examples below demonstrate usage.

## Examples

❌ "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?"

✅ `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.`

✅ `L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.`

✅ `repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.`

✅ `L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.`

✅ `L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.`

## Scoring

End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.`

If there is nothing to cut, say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes,
and performance are explicitly out of scope. Route them to a normal review
pass, not this one. A single smoke test or `assert`-based
self-check is the graybeard minimum, not bloat, never flag it for deletion.
Does not apply the fixes, only lists them.
"stop graybeard-review" or "normal mode": revert to verbose review style.
